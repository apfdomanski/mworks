description: >
    Used for interfacing to a network of `NE-500 syringe pumps
    <http://www.syringepump.com/oem.php#aa>`_, accessed via a serial-to-ethernet
    bridge or a USB-to-serial adapter
parameters: 
  - 
    name: address
    example:
      - '"10.0.254.254"'
      - '"/dev/cu.usbserial-FTH1RRH5"'
    description: |
        If `port`_ is provided, the address is taken to be a host name,
        and MWorks attempts to connect to the pump network via a
        `TCP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>`_
        socket.  Otherwise, the address is assumed to be a filesystem path that
        represents a serial port.

        If neither address nor port is provided, MWorks looks for a single,
        connected serial device.  If it finds one, it assumes it to be the
        desired pump network and attempts to connect.
  - 
    name: port
    example: 100
  - 
    name: response_timeout
    default: 100ms
  - 
    name: log_pump_commands
    default: 'YES'
